Physics And The User Interface For iOS
======================================

These are demo projects I use to accompany my Physics And The User Interface talk about UIKit Dynamics for iOS 7.

## What Are They?

**Dangle** is a simple view with a text field linked to an anchor and join in a chain, and a ball dropping with gravity to collide with the text field and make it whip back and forth. I use it as a walk through to show how to build a scene of behaviors one step at a time, and to demonstrate how the text field still works even while it is under the influence of the animator.

**DynamicCollection** is my version of a spring-like collection view layout and a dynamic layout that lets you resize cells and they snap into place with a dramatc wiggle.

**Pig Spinner** is a simple rotary spinner I wrote for my kids to use instead of the analog one that came with the game "Pen The Pig". It shows how to spin a view with angular momentum and read it's angle in real time to update a label to show what it is pointing at.
